This is the Ledger technology blog.


Ledger believes in security and transparency.
Most of our software and hardware development are open source.

Have a look at our [GitHub](https://github.com/ledgerhq).

Pull requests are welcome :)

If you're a developper and would like to write app on Nano S or Nano X, have a look to the [Documentation](https://developers.ledger.com/).
